# Email Analysis and Spam Classification with Streamlit
This Streamlit app performs an analysis of emails, including spam classification and visualizations of key insights. Users can input their email credentials to analyze their Gmail inbox.

# Overview

The app uses the following key components:

# 1.Spam Classification Model: 
A Multinomial Naive Bayes model is trained on a dataset of spam and non-spam (ham) emails to classify incoming emails. The model is trained using the subject lines of emails.

# 2.Email Analysis: 
The app connects to the user's Gmail account using IMAP and fetches email subjects, senders, and bodies.

# 3.Data Cleaning: 
The fetched data is cleaned by removing HTML tags, extra spaces, and other unwanted elements to prepare it for analysis.

# 4.Visualization of Top Words: 
The app creates a bar plot displaying the top 10 most frequent words in email bodies after cleaning.
